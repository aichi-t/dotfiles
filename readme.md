# Setup

1. Copy the dotfiles / config files to this repository's directory
2. Add a symlink in `install.conf.yaml`. eg. `~/.zshrc: zshrc` (where to create the symlink: where the symlink should point to)
3. Duplicate the original config files to somewhere else temporarily.
4. Delete the original config files
5. run `./install`. Reload necessary applications to verify that the symlink is working correctly.
6. Remove files from step 3.
